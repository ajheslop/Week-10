## Task One

1. Create a basic class in app.py that has several functions (e.g. calculator)

2. Create a file called tests.py

3. Write Unit Tests in tests.py that test the following:

    * The class in app.py is instantiated properly
    * All functions in app.py have at least 1 associated  unit test
    * Include a setUp() method with appropriate code
    
4. Upload app.py and tests.py to new GitHub repo

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Task Two

1. Create a Selenium script that performs Functional tests on the front-end of an application

2. Must include:

setUp and tearDown() methods
* At least 1 test per route/URL endpoint
* At least 2 different Unit Test assertions e.g. AssertIn and AssertEquals

4. Upload selenium_script.py alongside application code to GitHub (ensure you include an updated requirements.txt file)
